- Hi, I’m @HWAP
- I’m interested in building machine learning models
- I’m currently learning Rstudio and Python. I am the definition of a beginner, but I have a background in Aerospace Engineering and MATLAB so I am hoping to pick these coding laguages up with some sort of speed
- I am a prior F-18 Pilot and current Business School student looking for Product Manager or Business Operations roles with great teammates, a fast paced work environment, the ability to help the proverbial greater good
